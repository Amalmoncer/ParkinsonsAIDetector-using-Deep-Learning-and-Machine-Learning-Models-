In this GitHub repository, we train a dataset comprising biomedical voice measurements using various machine learning and deep learning algorithms to create a model for Parkinson's disease early detection. 
These algorithms used include:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
3. Neural Networks model (deep learning)
4. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model (deep learning)
5. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model (deep learning)
6. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network (deep learning)
